This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in COBOL programs involving array manipulation. The code attempts to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 and store the intermediate sums in an array. However, it incorrectly accesses and displays the array elements, leading to an incorrect result. The solution shows how to fix this to accurately calculate and display the sum.
